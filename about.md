This site is about the search for extending the [.NET](https://www.microsoft.com/net) [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) [F# language](http://fsharp.org/) with [aspect-oriented features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming).
The work is based on [AspectML - Aspect-oriented Functional Programming Language Research](http://sip.cs.princeton.edu/projects/aspectml/).
This site is located at [naseukoly.cz/aspectfsharp](http://www.naseukoly.cz/aspectfsharp/).
