We are targeting [Microsoft .NET][dotnet] in our search. We see Microsoft as the biggest and most important software vendor in the [information worker][informationworker] market (people working with office software suits) and also market dominant in PC operating systems. 

Microsoft also had kind-of bad reputation before, but it changed a lot in last year and for example has opened .NET and [created cross-platform][introducingcoreclr] [CoreCLR][coreclr].

.NET allows you to target both people using PCs at office work, people using supported Unix variants at work and also servers.
